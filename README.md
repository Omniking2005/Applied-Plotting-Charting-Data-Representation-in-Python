# Applied-Plotting-Charting-Data-Representation-in-Python
Coursera-Applied Plotting, Charting Data Representation in Python by University of Michigan

This was my second course on data science which helped me that how to visualize data.
Here I did my First Project on Data Science - "EFFECT OF RELIGIOUS EVENTS ON ENVIRONMENT"
.The base of this research project was that "DO THE RELIGIOUS EVENTS HAVE ANY MAJOR EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENT?"
also I got datasets from followwing links

Here the visualization was concerned with does the effects of the religious event on the environment of Ahmedabad as compared to regular days. Later plotting the graph it seems that the religious events do not affect the environment as compared to regular days and I learned that air quality is not affected by religious events. Indeed, the chart answer an interesting question, and the answer is contrary to what we would think. In fact, I would have thought that religious events would have led to greater displacement of people, lading to a worsening of the air quality.But the results shows the major air pollution contributor is Manufacturing Industries.

Here I used Cairo's principle of insightfulness with one or more elements of their visual.
